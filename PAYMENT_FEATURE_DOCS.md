# Laundry Management System - Payment Feature

## Overview
This document describes the payment functionality implemented for the laundry management system.

## Features Added

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- `payment_method` (string): Stores payment method ('cash' or 'transfer')
- `payment_status` (integer): Enum for payment status (payment_pending: 0, payment_completed: 1)
- `received_at` (datetime): Timestamp when order was received
- `started_washing_at` (datetime): Timestamp when washing started
- `completed_washing_at` (datetime): Timestamp when washing completed
- `paid_at` (datetime): Timestamp when payment was made

### 2. Order Status Workflow
The order now follows this complete workflow:
1. **Received** (received: 0) - Order is received and waiting to start
2. **Washing** (washing: 1) - Order is being processed/washed
3. **Completed** (completed: 2) - Washing is done, ready for payment
4. **Paid** (paid: 3) - Payment has been received, order is complete

### 3. Payment Methods
- **Cash** (cash): Direct cash payment
- **Transfer** (transfer): Bank transfer payment

### 4. Model Updates
- **Order Model**: Added payment enums, validations, and timestamp callbacks
- **Status Methods**: `paid?`, `payment_completed?`, etc.
- **Text Methods**: `payment_method_text` for user-friendly display
- **Validation**: Payment method required when payment is completed

### 5. Controller Updates
- **OrdersController**: Added `make_payment` action
- **Payment Processing**: Handles payment method selection and status updates
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Automatically sets timestamps for status changes

### 6. View Updates
- **Index Page**: Added payment status column and paid filter button
- **Show Page**: Added payment information section and payment modal
- **Timeline**: Visual timeline showing order progress with timestamps
- **Payment Modal**: User-friendly payment method selection interface

### 7. Routes
- Added `patch :make_payment` route for payment processing

### 8. CSS Styling
- Timeline visualization for order progress
- Payment method selection styling
- Responsive layout improvements

## Usage

### For Order Processing Staff:
1. Create new order → Status: "Received"
2. Click "Start Washing" → Status: "Washing"
3. Click "Complete Washing" → Enter weight and total amount → Status: "Completed"
4. Click "Payment" → Select payment method → Status: "Paid"

### For Management:
- Filter orders by status including "Paid" status
- View complete timeline of each order
- Track payment methods used
- Monitor order completion times

## Technical Implementation

### Enum Conflict Resolution
- Resolved enum method name conflicts between `status` and `payment_status`
- Used descriptive enum values: `payment_pending`, `payment_completed`

### Timestamp Automation
- Automatic timestamp setting through ActiveRecord callbacks
- Ensures accurate tracking of order progress

### Data Integrity
- Validations ensure required fields are present at appropriate stages
- Payment method required only when payment is completed
- Weight and amount required only for completed/paid orders

## Future Enhancements
- Email notifications for payment confirmations
- SMS notifications to customers
- Receipt generation and printing
- Payment reporting and analytics
- Multiple payment method support (partial payments)
